<h1>Calculator</h1>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The calculator works by listening to user input from both buttons and keyboard events. The input is processed to form an expression, and JavaScript's built-in eval() function is used to calculate the result. Proper validation is done to prevent invalid expressions and edge cases such as division by zero.</p>
